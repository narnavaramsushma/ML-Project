## End to End Machine Learing Project

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow, covering data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, training, and evaluation using Python.

The goal of this project is to understand the complete ML pipeline and apply machine learning techniques to real-world data.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow

- Data collection and loading
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance analysis

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Dataset

A structured dataset (CSV format) was used for training and testing the machine learning models.

## 📈 Results

The model performance was evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy and error rates.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required dependencies
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and evaluate the model
